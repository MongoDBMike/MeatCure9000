# MeatCure9000
making cured sausage just like Nono used to.

After coming home from my most recent trip back home to Thunder Bay, I brought home a package of 6 dried sausages my Dad and I made a while back.  A week and a half later, peeling my last one I realized this isnt sustainable - I need to make my own. 

The problem: I live in downtown Toronto and do not have a cellar to hang the sausage.  

When you cure meat you need to be able to control tempature, humidity and air flow. This is something I should be able to do! I thought to myself, I can just buy a minifidge, a humidifier and a fan!  However, Im constantly out of town for work, I cant manually turn all of these devices on and off. 

After googling, Kijiji'ing, and Amazon Prime shopping, 24 hours later I had a Raspberry Pi, a mini fridge, a humidifer, a soldering iron, a computer fan, radio frequency sniffer and emitters ... etc.
